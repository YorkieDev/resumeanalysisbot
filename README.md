# Resume Analysis Bot

A resume analysis bot that extracts text from a PDF resume and uses a custom LLM (powered by your LM Studio server) to provide detailed, expert feedback. The bot acts as a seasoned career advisorâ€”identifying key skills, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and providing actionable suggestions for improvement. After the initial analysis, you can ask follow-up questions to get further advice on how to improve the resume.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Uses [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) to extract resume text from PDF files.
- **LLM Integration:** Leverages a custom LLM class that interacts with your LM Studio server API.
- **Prompt Template:** Uses [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to structure the input prompt.
- **Interactive Follow-Up:** Allows you to ask follow-up questions about resume improvements after the initial analysis.
- **Modular & Modern Pipeline:** Formats prompts and directly invokes the LLM, avoiding deprecated classes.

## Prerequisites
